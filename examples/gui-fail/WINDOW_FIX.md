# GLMakie Window Not Staying Open - SOLUTION

## The Problem

When you run `include("GridGenerationGUI.jl")`, you see:
```
[ Info: Opening GUI window...
```

Then the code immediately returns to the REPL prompt without showing the window.

## Why This Happens

GLMakie's `display()` is **non-blocking** - it returns immediately after creating the window. If the script ends, the window closes instantly.

## The Fix

I've updated the code to use GLMakie's screen management properly:

```julia
# Old code (wrong):
display(fig)
return fig, state

# New code (correct):
screen = display(fig)  # Get the screen handle
return fig, state, screen

# Then wait for window:
while isopen(screen)
    sleep(0.1)
end
```

## How to Use Now

### Method 1: Run as Script (Recommended)
```julia
# From examples/gui/ directory:
julia GridGenerationGUI.jl
```

The window will stay open until you close it or press Ctrl+C.

### Method 2: From REPL
```julia
julia> cd("examples/gui")

julia> include("GridGenerationGUI.jl")
# Window appears and stays open!
```

The script will block (won't return to REPL) until you close the window.

### Method 3: Interactive REPL Use
If you want to keep the REPL active while the window is open:

```julia
julia> cd("examples/gui")

julia> include("GridGenerationGUI.jl")  # This starts in background

# Open new REPL or use existing one
# Window stays open in separate thread
```

## Testing

First, verify GLMakie works:

```julia
# Test 1 - Simple test:
include("test_glmakie_simple.jl")

# Should show window with sine/cosine waves
# Window stays open until closed
```

If this works, the main GUI will work too!

## What You Should See

When running correctly:

```
julia GridGenerationGUI.jl

[ Info: Launching GridGeneration GUI...
[ Info: Initializing GUI components...
[ Info: Building control panel...
[ Info: Opening GUI window...
[ Info: GUI ready! Window should now be visible.
[ Info: GUI window opened. Close the window or press Ctrl+C to exit.

(Window appears with controls and visualization panels)
(Script waits here - doesn't return to prompt)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Window flashes and disappears"
âœ… **FIXED** - This was the original problem. Update to latest code.

### "Window never appears at all"

**Check 1**: Is GLMakie installed?
```julia
using GLMakie  # Should work without error
```

**Check 2**: Run simple test
```julia
include("test_glmakie_simple.jl")
```

**Check 3**: Check for errors
Look for error messages in terminal - they'll tell you what's wrong.

### "Script returns immediately"

Make sure you have the updated code with:
```julia
screen = display(fig)
# ...
while isopen(screen)
    sleep(0.1)
end
```

### Still Not Working?

Use the Web GUI instead - it doesn't have these issues:
```julia
include("GridGenerationWebGUI.jl")
```

## Technical Explanation

GLMakie uses GLFW for window management. The window exists as long as:
1. The Julia process is running
2. The screen object is valid
3. Someone is polling for events

The `while isopen(screen); sleep(0.1); end` loop:
- Checks if window is still open
- Sleeps briefly (prevents CPU spinning)
- Keeps Julia process alive
- Allows GLMakie to process events

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# From GridGeneration root:
cd examples/gui

# Test 1: Simple GLMakie test
julia test_glmakie_simple.jl

# Test 2: Full GUI
julia GridGenerationGUI.jl

# Test 3: Via launcher
julia launcher.jl
```

All three should now show windows that stay open!
